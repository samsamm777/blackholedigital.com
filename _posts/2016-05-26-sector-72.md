*First iteration wrench model in Maya*

We started development of Sector:72 on the 17th Feb 2016, so that's around 4 months of 
work so far. We figured now is a good time to start up the dev blog as we have now 
got a rough idea of what were doing. I'm aiming to use this dev blog to keep you all
updated on the progress of our game and to go into some detail about some areas of
decision making and any major technical problems we solve.

Recently i've been tackling persisting the game state to disk so we can save/load
the game from a context menu. So far it hasnt been overly difficult but its a whole
load of data wrangling with a bunch of systems that I build without really taking
serialization too much into consideration. So I had to do some refactoring to get
the game manager classes into a state where they would serialize nicely and play
ball. I've got a whole load more work to do with this system over the next week or
so, but I hope to get its first incarnation working to a degree where I can rely
on it.

Also recently I've been working on the 'Jobs' system, which is how we manage the
tasks in which each bot uses to determine what is has to do. The job system is a 
simple FIFO(first in first out) queue, bots when they are idle continually monitor
the queue for jobs and when something appears they grab it and get to work depending
on what type of task it is. So far we only have transport bots, so the only tasks
are to take an item from A to B and drop it off. However in future there will be 
repair tasks, build tasks etc. So the job system needs to be as generic as possible
to cater for this variation. I've got the basics of the system implemented and its
working. Which is a start.

Also as pictured, we started working on some of the equipment models. These are 
various tools the player uses to work on machines. Wrenches, hammers etc.

Changes & Fixes:

- Saving and loading game state
- job system
